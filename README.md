This is my first project for The Odin Project, a Recipe Website

By the end of this project, I expect to demonstrate all the skills and lessons that I have learnt so far from this project.

I expect to demonstrate a basic understanding of Bash comands, Git and Github workflows. Additionally, I am looking forward to applying my knowledge the basics of HTML.
