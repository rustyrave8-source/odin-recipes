            <p>Leche Flan is essentially a Filipino version of creme caramel.</p>
            <p>It is a sweet dish traditionally served as dessert at fiestas, parties, and other special occasions.</p>
            <p>This dessert consists of a layer of caramelized sugar and a custard mixture of egg yolks, evaporated milk, and condensed milk.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>10 egg yolks</li>
                <li>1 can (370) ml evaporated or fresh milk - or fresh milk</li>
                <li>1 can (300) ml sweetened condensed milk</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon key lime or lemon zest (optional)</li>
                <li>9 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare the caramel. Scoop 3 tablespoons of sugar in each (3 small) llanera or flan molds or 4 tablespoons for big llanera. Place the llanera on top of the stove over low heat. When the sugar starts to liquefy, using tongs, turn the llanera in a circular motion to prevent the sugar from burning and let them caramelize evenly. Remove from heat once all granules have turned liquid and are light brown. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Place the egg yolks in a bowl, and slowly beat them with a fork or whisk. Try not to beat too fast and create a lot of bubbles. Gradually add the milk and condensed milk while continuously stirring. Lastly, add the vanilla extract and zest of key lime or lemon and stir a couple of times more until all is well blended. Sieve the mixture with a strainer to remove undissolved bits.</li>
                <li>Pour the mixture into each mold. Tap the mold several times on a flat surface to get rid of trapped bubbles. Place the filled llanera or mold in a water bath and bake in the oven at 160°C/320°F for about 30 minutes or until an inserted toothpick comes out clean. Do not overcook or the will start to create tiny holes.</li>
                <li>Let them cool down and then chill in the fridge for at least an hour. When ready to serve, run a knife around the inner edges to separate the flan from the mold. Place a serving plate top-side down over the llanera and flip them over to transfer.</li>
